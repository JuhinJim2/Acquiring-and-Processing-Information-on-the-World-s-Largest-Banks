# Python Data Engineering Project: Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks

## Project Objective:

Create a code that can be used to compile the list of top banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accrodance with the exchange rate information that has been made available thru a CSV file. The processed inforamtion table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.

## ETL Process using Python

1. Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
2. Extract the required data from the different file types.
3. Transform data to the required format.
4. Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.

## Web scraping and Extracting Data using APIs

1. Use the [requests], [BeautifulSoup] and [pandas] libraries to web scrape the contents of a web page.
2. Analyze the HTML code of a webpage to find relevant information.
3. Extract the relevant information and save in a CSV file.
4. Load the dataframe into a SQL Database.

## Python Initialized Database

1. Create modules
2. Run unit test 
3. Package applications
4. Static code analysis# Acquiring-and-Processing-Information-on-the-World-s-Largest-Banks
